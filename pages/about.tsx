          Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Alan, and I like to learn things, and then try
          and use what I learned to make things. Most of the time what I make
          isn&apos;t super useful, but you can bet I had a lot of fun doing it!
          I&apos;m creating this site to document what I&apos;ve made, learned,
          and other things that keep me up at night. I hope you enjoy reading!
        </Typography>
      </Box>
    </DefaultLayout>
  );
