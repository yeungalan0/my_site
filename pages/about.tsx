      My name is Alan, and I like to learn things, and then try and use what I
      learned to make things. Most of the time what I make isn&apos;t super
      useful, but you can bet I had a lot of fun doing it! I&apos;m creating
      this site to document what I&apos;ve made, learned, and other things that
      keep me up at night. I hope you enjoy reading!
