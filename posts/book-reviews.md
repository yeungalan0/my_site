# Purpose

Inspired by [Bryan Braun's](https://www.bryanbraun.com/books/) book review list,
I thought I'd start a similar one of my own.

# Greenlights

Rating: 5/5

Overall I thought this was an entertaining book that was a fun (and short)
listen. It was honest in that it was largely a self reflection on Matthew's
life, filled with a variety of amusing stories, and distilled some life lessons
that will probably help most people. It was just as advertised and I wanted
nothing more.

## Lessons

- One story that really struck me was during Matthew's start in Hollywood. He
  mentioned to someone that he really needed some work, and right there at that
  instance he was reprimanded and basically told that in that industry
  desperation is akin to self sabotage. You can't need anything, cause that's
  the perfect path to not get it. Matthew understood right then and there, you
  cannot be seen as needing anything in the industry, for like sharks people
  will smell the fear and desperation and tear you apart. So what was Matthew's
  answer on how to go from needing to simply wanting? He spent pretty much all
  his remaining money on a motorbike backpacking trip across Europe.
  - This is applicable in many other settings, want it don't need it, for those
    that need it won't get it
- Reflection is important for growth, everyone should take some time every now
  and then to look back and try to squeeze out any lessons from the shit pile of
  experiences you've had
- A lesson/theme throughout is to keep pushing, it's not the success in and of
  itself that matters, but just making the attempt that opens doors. Matthew did
  some crazy things in the book from going to South America to Africa on a wet
  dream whim, to his acting experiments, but I think each one opened (and some
  closed) doors for him to develop his own path. Much better to try and fail
  than not attempt at all...or so it's easier typed than done.
- I recall the story of Matthew and his brother gambling in Vegas, making a fair
  amount of money, then to lose it all on one bad sports bet. His lesson, which
  I think bears repeating, is that we remember victories more than failures, and
  take responsibility for the victories...but never the failures.
- Matthew also had a moment where he realized the characters he was playing were
  becoming more interesting than his own real life, and that's not what he
  wanted. I think that's an important realization and theme throughout this
  book, you should strive to live a life that will be entertaining to you when
  you look back on it, otherwise, what's the point? It's that old saying, 20
  years from now you'll be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by
  the things you did.
- Another striking story was one from his adventures in Africa where he was
  caught in the middle of a heated argument between two African friends. Matthew
  perked up and mentioned that he agreed with one persons point of view and
  thought it was right, and was then heavily reprimanded. He didn't understand
  the point of the argument, it wasn't about right or wrong, it was about
  understanding. "They are not trying to win arguments of right or wrong. They
  are trying to understand each other." This is a lesson really valuable in
  today's time, sometimes there is not a right or a wrong answer, but what's
  important is just to understand that someone's answer is a reasonable one.

# Influence

Overall I liked this book. There were a lot of ideas that seemed like "common
sense", but we all know that's not too common, and we can all use a refresher on
these ideas. I also found several new ideas in this book, particularly eye
opening to me was the chapter on social proof that made me think about how much
I depend on social proof in my own life...perhaps too much so.

## Reciprocity:

- Rituals bond people, like army/Greek life initiation. The more it sucks the
  more people are bonded, and feel an affinity toward the organization.
- Creating a scenario to change someone's inner feelings/view is a strong method
  of influence. Ex. Having a car discount, trying out the car, then getting the
  discount taken away and still buying the car because you "realize" it's still
  a good car. Homeowners entered into an energy saving competition ended up
  saving more energy after prize was taken away since they "realized" they were
  green people all along.

## Commitment and consistency

- People want to be consistent, often to a fault. Tells a story about a young
  lady, asking about a "survey", where he spouts a hyperbole about being very
  social, and then is asked if he'd like to buy a coupon book, because it makes
  sense for someone as social as himself

## Social Proof

- Social proof is an important factor of influence and one that I constantly use
  in areas like fashion advice, reviews, or upvotes on reddit
- Used when a long line of cars change lanes, but nothing is blocking the way
- Used to determine how you should react in a situation, like in the Bystander
  Effect where if everyone's calm in an emergency situation you will likely be
  too
- Used in the Jones Town community suicide where other people committing the act
  put pressure on you to as well and making it seem like the "reasonable" thing
  to do
  - In the majority of instances people would not think this was rational, but
    isolated in a foreign place, given up pretty much everything, and with only
    these contacts many may see this as a reasonable choice

## Authority

- The famous Milgram obedience experiment involving electric shocks
- Authority can also be conferred from a title or by the way you dress
- Even if you don't actually have the title this can apply, like the actor who
  played a doctor who was used in medical related ads

## Liking

- People want to be liked, people often avoid bringing bad news and volunteer to
  bring good news as they know this will make them better liked (even if
  illogical), this is liking by association.
- Sales people use names of friends that you like to influence you to buy
  products
- Anyone who is considered "good looking" can get away with a lot in society

## Scarcity

- There are a limited number or it's only available for a limited time...these
  are some common tactics that employ scarcity
- People often want what they cannot have, and when something goes from abundant
  to scarce people can develop an interest when there was none before
- When Jen asked a Banh Mi place if they would be open the next day, and they
  said they would, but told her to buy now since the next day there'd be a long
  line (when there was no reason for this)
- There's a "I don't like being told what to do" principle here, where if
  someone tells you not to do something (trying to make it scarce), you want to
  do it more
- Scarcity can influence your view on other people, things, and/or ideas
  (knowledge).
- Competition creates the feeling of scarcity as well. You can think of
  competition for a mate making the mate seem more attractive, bidding
  competition makes you lose your mind, or the book gives an example of
  gathering competition to sell a car by telling potential buyers to come at the
  same time
