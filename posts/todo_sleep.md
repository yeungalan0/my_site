# Purpose

Document why you should care about sleep, and what helps you sleep well to live
a long and happy life.

# Why do I care

[NUMEROUS][sleep-search] [sites][sleep-site], [videos][sleep-videos], and
experts preach the overwhelming benefits of sleep, and yet, so people actually
value it with common sayings as "you can sleep when you're dead". But what if
you die sooner without sleep?

Just to list a [few known benefits][sleep-benefits], sleep has shown to:

- improve your cognitive/mental functions (including memory)
- improve your emotional regulation
- improve your happiness/general mood
- improve your immune system functions

So sleep can make you happier, healthier, and smarter? Wow, it really is our
[super power][sleep-superpower].

# Rules for a great sleep

These are my personal rules for sleep that are [evidence backed][sleep-hygiene],
and through personal experimentation have been shown to work for me. YMMV on
trying these rules for yourself, but more likely than not they will work for you
too.

- Wake up at approximately the same time EVERY DAY
  - This personally has been more helpful (and sometimes more painful) than
    having a bedtime that basically forces a natural bedtime for me
- Let your body wake up naturally at the end of it's sleep cycle
  - This is why I said "approximately" above, and I use a wake up light to
    signal my wake up in the morning. I can sleep through it, but I usually
    don't. I've found this to be a much more enjoyable way to wake up than with
    a alarm blaring me awake when I'm right in the middle of a sweet dream about
    eating ice cream on the moon.
- The room must be relatively cool/cold (around 68 degrees)
- You need to stop using computers and prepare your body for bed at least 1 hour
  before you get in bed
- The room must be as pitch black as possible
- Have a religious bedtime ritual so your body knows exactly when itâ€™s time for
  sleep
