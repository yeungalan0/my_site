# Purpose

Details my life goals, committed to git so I can't back outta them like a wuss
in my later years (that's right future Alan, I know you're thinking about
wussing out, don't do it). As far as I know I only have this one life, and I
really, above all, want to make the most of it. I think having this list will
help.
