# Purpose

Details my life goals/bucket list, committed to git so I can't back outta them
like a wuss in my later years (that's right future Alan, I know you're thinking
about wussing out, DON'T do it). As far as I know I only have this one life, and
I really, above all, want to make the most of it. I think having this list will
help keep me on the right track.

# Rules

I'll add to this list as the years go by, but I won't remove/cross off from this
list without having completed the goal...unless I have a very VERY good reason
(which will be noted).

I may also visit countries
