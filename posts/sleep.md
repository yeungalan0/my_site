# Purpose

Document why you should care about sleep, what helps you sleep well to live a
long and happy life.

# Rules

- Wake up at the same time EVERY DAY
- The room must be relatively cool/cold (around 68 degrees)
- You need to stop using computers and prepare your body for bed at least 1 hour
  before you get in bed
- The room must be as pitch black as possible
- Have a religious bedtime ritual so your body knows exactly when itâ€™s time for
  sleep
