# Purpose

Details the work done for my [Advent of Code 2020][aoc-repo] repository,
including algorithms, tech used, and lessons learned.

# Concept

[Advent of Code][aoc-about] is an [advent calendar][advent-calendar] where you
count down the days till Christmas (my most favorite holiday) by solving
programming puzzles. It's a great way to sharpen your coding skills, and have a
lot of fun at the same time! This was my first year attempting the problems, and
I decided to solve the problems in a new language (Go) and ensure I have
reasonable test coverage for each of the problems.

# Tech used

- Go(lang): I think I've fallen in love with a language. Great language for
  backend APIs/microservices, super fast, and love the language simplicity!
- [Gitpod][gitpod]: Awesome web IDE/development platform. It was really simple
  to use and I'll probably set up other personal projects on it...if only they
  had good enterprise support! :(

# Lessons learned

## Chinese remainder theorem

I took number theory in college...but honestly I forgot this existed, and it was
only thanks too Google and kind redditors that I was able to solve the problem
in a waaay easier way using this theorem. It was also pretty fun to get back
into number theory and remember that math and CS do go together pretty dang
well.

## Recursion

Recursion is some fun stuff. Recursion is some fun stuff. Seriously though, I
solved a fair number of the problems using recursion (it's pretty rare that I
have a need to use a recursive solution at work), and I forgot how elegant and
powerful recursion can be!

## Linked lists

Linked lists are a thing, and were perfect for solving a particular calendar
problem! It was pretty fun to create one, and they are interesting...not super
useful in a lot of my day to day programming, but should definitely remember
that they exist!

## Getting help

Honestly I learned a lot from Advent of Code, not just from implementing
solutions, but also by getting stumped on problems and finding amazing
programmers on reddit who solved it in 5 lines. Or by creating a terrible
solution and seeing someone else implement the same solution with a minor tweak
that makes it 100X more performant. You can just learn so much from other
people, and many of those problems were a good reminder that often
asking/looking for help is the best route to learn and solve the problem.
