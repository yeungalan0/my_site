# Purpose

Quick summary for me on how I should best utilize an HSA and why. Other's have
already written about what an HSA is and the benefits of an HSA way better than
I can (see the [references](#references)), and I'd rather not regurgitate what
they've said. Instead, I'll summarize the key lessons/tricks for me here, and
resources I used to learn these lessons.

**Disclaimer: This article is not financial or tax advice.** It is a reference
for myself, but may not be accurate as tax laws change. Please seek advice from
a financial professional and/or do your research before making any decisions.

# Prerequisites

- An understanding of basic tax advantaged accounts like a traditional IRA and
  roth IRA
- Ensure you meet the requirements to contribute to an HSA [1]
- Ensure you have a basic understanding of what an HSA account is [2] [3]

# How to utilize an HSA

- Prioritize putting savings/retirement money in an HSA above all other accounts
  since it's the most tax advantaged [3]
- Invest as much of the HSA funds as you can so they can grow tax free with
  compound interest [4]
- Don't withdraw **any** funds (even medical bills) from an HSA until you
  absolutely need to in retirement to maximize compound interest growth [6]
- Relating to the above, if you spend your HSA funds on non-medical expenses
  before age 65, you must pay a 20% penalty, but after age 65 the spending just
  counts as ordinary income, making an HSA the equivalent of a traditional IRA
  for non-medical expenses! [7]
- If you must pay for medical bills using HSA funds, first pay using your credit
  card, and then reimburse yourself afterwards so you can collect points [5]
